* LaWTeX notes
** questions
- Why are macros starting with backslash-at (\@) allowed in
  bluebook.sty?
- Why do edefs in some places cause errors?
** Objectives
- Maintain backward compatibility.
- Allow state customizations.
- Allow for modifications.
- The [n] flag for reporter or reporter year citations is not working properly. Does not seem to work at all for first cite, and is pincite page only for subsequent cites.

** Tasks
*** TODO Testing
Use tests like https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/42328/testing-framework-api-for-latex.
**** DONE create test directory and macros
**** TODO write tests
***** DONE test the testing framework
***** DONE test short name generation
***** DONE test citation separation
***** DONE test parseCase
***** DONE write citation builder, test
Write a partial application of citation and citationAt using the
currying techniques in curry1 and curry2.
Test seperately and make all the tests in test*.tex pass. This should
take a few hours, but after this the job should be largely done.
***** TODO Remove Eval code from bluebook
***** TODO Test the rest of bluebook code with the new citation macros
****** TODO short cite
****** TODO long cite
****** TODO index cite

***** TODO test citecase
***** TODO test cite
***** TODO test pincite
***** TODO test duplicate case names
Use a bash script, because the latex build fails when the test passes.
I tried to use colors but abandoned the effort because it was taking
too much time.
***** TODO Prepare bluebook.sty for testing
The assert macro of the testing framework only tests clean
strings. (It cannot handle emphasized strings.) The macros in bluebook
should be rewritten so as to allow the testing of clean strings. We
can also test the output of the final `\textbackslash{}cite` and
`\textbackslash{}pincite` macros by eye, not using the assert macro.

Need to track down how cases are printed.
Start with \cite then \pincite
\cite -> @bbsource -> @bbReporterOnlyCite
\cite -> @bbsource -> @bbReporterOnlyPinCite
\cite -> @bbsource -> @bbLongCite -> \@bbCaseLongCite
\cite -> @bbsource -> @bbShortCite

***** TODO test cases with 1 cite.
***** test cases with 2 cites.

*** TODO Extension
Extend the existing framework to allow parallel citations and slip opinions.

** Thoughts
*** Localization
States have different rules for citations. It would be nice to make all the localizations in one file to avoid the development of incompatible development between different states.
