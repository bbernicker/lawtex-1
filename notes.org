* LaWTeX notes
** Objectives
- Maintain backward compatibility.
- Allow state customizations.
- Allow for modifications.

** Tasks
*** TODO Testing
Use tests like https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/42328/testing-framework-api-for-latex.
**** DONE create test directory and macros
**** TODO write tests
***** DONE test duplicate case names
***** TODO test cases with 1 cite.
*** TODO Extension
Extend the existing framework to allow parallel citations and slip opinions.

** Thoughts
*** Localization
States have different rules for citations. It would be nice to make all the localizations in one file to avoid the development of incompatible development between different states.
