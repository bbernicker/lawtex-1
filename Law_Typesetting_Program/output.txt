J URISDICTIONAL S TATEMENT
The judgment of the Court of Appeals was entered on March 29,
2010. The petition for writ of certiorari was filed on October 22, 2010,
and was granted on March 28, 2011. This Court has jurisdiction under
Title 28, United States Code§ 1254(1).

S TATEMENT OF THE C ASE
Petitioner Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School
(“The Church”) is a Lutheran church community centered on living out
the Word of God as expressed through the Gospels. The Church is a
member of the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod (LCMS), the oldest
Lutheran denomination in the United States.1 As part of its ministry,
Hosanna-Tabor provides a Christ-centered elementary school, which
helps parents reinforce biblical principles and standards. See E.E.O.C.
v. Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School (HosannaTabor I), 582 F. Supp. 2d 881, 884 (E.D. Mich. 2008). As the district
court noted, “Hosanna-Tabor also characterizes its staff members as
“fine Christian role models who integrate their faith into all subjects.’ ”

S UMMARY OF A RGUMENT
The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof.” The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses are rooted in the
Founders’ understanding that “the best interest of a society require[s]
that the minds of men always be wholly free.” Everson v. Bd. of Ed. of
Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 12 (1947). Therefore, these Religion Clauses prohibit the “excessive entanglement” of church and state. See Walz v.
Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664, 670 (1970). In particular, “there is substantial danger that the State will become entangled
in essentially religious controversies or intervene on behalf of groups
espousing particular doctrinal beliefs” when hearing internal church
disputes. Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese for the USA and Canada v.
Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 696, 709 (1976). Therefore, lower courts have developed the “ministerial exception,” by which the courts will not examine
a church’s decision to hire or fire its ministers.
This case turns on whether the Respondent, Cheryl Perich, was
a minister of Hosanna-Tabor Church and School. She was. However,
3



the Court of Appeals relied on a “primary duties” to reach the opposite
conclusion. This conclusion was contrary to the facts. They should have
recognized that their numerical balancing test on the “primary duties”
was based on the improper determination that certain activities are
“non-religious” (improper because it was outside of the subject-matter
jurisdiction of the courts). The Court should take a more formalistic,
bright-line rule.
The Petitioner maintains that when a church has held out to the
public that a person is their minister, and that person accepts that
designation, the person is a minister for the purpose of the exception.
Unlike religious matters, courts are well-suited to determine whether
the parties agreed to assume a binding relationship between one another.
In this case, the Church repeatedly designated Ms. Perich as a
“minister.” She was sent diplomas, letters, and other forms attesting to
this status. And she also accepted the offer, without coercion, and took
advantage of the benefits. For example, she relied on a loan guarantee
that is only available to those engaged in ministry. Therefore, she should
4



be bound by her bargain, and viewed by this Court as the minister that
she once claimed to be.

A RGUMENT
A.

Standard of Review
The parties contest the appropriate standard of review regarding

the ministerial exception. Petitioner Hosanna-Tabor requests this Court
to consider the claim as a challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction, cf.
Fed. R. Civ. P.12(b)(1), as did both the district court and the Court of
Appeals. Thus the legal conclusions of the lower courts are reviewed de
novo, and factual findings are affirmed unless clearly erroneous. See
E.E.O.C. v. Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School
(Hosanna-Tabor II), 597 F.3d 769, 776 (6th Cir. 2010).
The district court’s judgment was not specifically in response to a
12(b)(1) motion. Instead, the court issued its judgment in response to a
Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. Typically, an entry of summary
judgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine dispute as to any

5



material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”
Fed. R. Civ. P.56.
However, Sixth Circuit precedent views the ministerial exception
as jurisdictional. See Hosanna-Tabor II, 597 F.3d at 775. A challenge
to subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived, and may be considered
by the court sua sponte at any point during the litigation. See Arbaugh
v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006). In contrast to a motion for
summary judgment or a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, on a 12(b)(1) motion
a court must make such findings of fact as are necessary to establish
jurisdiction. See id. Everson, 330 U.S. at 13
The Sixth Circuit was correct to view the ministerial exception as
a jurisdictional challenge. The ministerial exception is a recognition
by secular courts of their incompetence to judge the qualifications of
religious ministers. The Constitution accordingly placed such matters
outside of those courts’ subject-matter jurisdiction. Cf. Milivojevich, 426
U.S. at 713(“religious controversies are not the proper subject of civil
court inquiry”). Therefore, once a party has asserted the ministerial

6



defense, a court must determine such facts as are necessary to determine
if it has jurisdiction over the matter, and must recuse itself if it does not.
B.

The Ministerial Exception
“The relationship between an organized church and its ministers

is its lifeblood,” as the Fifth Circuit recognized 40 years ago in one of
the initial cases on the ministerial exception. McClure v. Salvation
Army, 460 F.2d 553, 560 (5th Cir. 1972). “The minister is the chief
instrument by which the church seeks to fulfill its purpose.” Id. at 561.
Moreover, “[a] minister is not merely an employee of the church; she
is the embodiment of its message.” Petruska v. Gannon Univ., 462
F.3d 294, 306 (3d Cir. 2006). “A minister serves as the church’s public
representative, its ambassador, and its voice to the faithful.” Id.
Since McClure, all of the circuits have followed the Fifth Circuit to
hold that, given the special nature of the church–minister relationship,
they will not examine a church’s decisions to hire or fire its ministers,
even if the church may have violated employment laws. See, e.g., Rweyemamu v. Cote, 520 F.3d 198 (2d Cir. 2008); Petruska; Elvig v. Calvin
Presbyterian Church, 375 F. 3d 951 (9th Cir. 2004); E.E.O.C. v. Catholic
7



Univ. of America, 83 F.3d 455 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Lewis v. Seventh Day
Adventists Lake Region Conf., 978 F.2d 940 (6th Cir. 1992); Natal v.
Christian and Missionary Alliance, 878 F.2d 1575 (1st Cir. 1989).
1.

The Ministerial Exception is a necessary consequence of the First
Amendment’s guarantee of Freedom of Religion

This ministerial exception, however, is not merely a prudential
doctrine of judicial restraint, but a necessary consequence of the Constitution’s commitment to religious freedom. Cf. U.S. C ONST. amend. I
(“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . .”). While this Court has not
spoken directly to the ministerial exception, the doctrine follows directly
from this Court’s interpretation of the Establishment and Free Exercise
Clauses.
As this Court has observed, the Religion Clauses derive from the
Framers’ recognition “that the best interest of a society require[s] that
the minds of men always be wholly free; and that cruel persecutions
were the inevitable result of government-established religions.” Everson,
330 U.S. at 12. But this Court has also recognized that churches can
8



and should play a vital and vigorous role in American society, such that
the Constitution’s aim is not to sever Church and State completely, but
merely to attempt to preserve their exclusive spheres. See Walz, 397
U.S. at 670(“No perfect or absolute separation is really possible; the very
existence of the Religion Clauses . . . seeks to mark boundaries to avoid
excessive entanglement.”).
Particularly when adjudicating internal church disputes, “there
is substantial danger that the State will become entangled in essentially religious controversies or intervene on behalf of groups espousing
particular doctrinal beliefs.” Milivojevich, 426 U.S. at 709. Everson,
330 U.S. at 15. Because of this danger, “the First Amendment severely
circumscribes the role that civil courts may play” in such matters. Presbyterian Church v. Hull Church, 393 U.S. 440, 449 (1969). Neither the
civil courts—nor any other arm of government—may interfere with a
church’s right to choose ministers as they see fit. See Kedroff v. St.
Nicholas Cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church in North America,
344 U.S. 94, 154–55 (1952)(“Freedom to select the clergy . . . must now
be said to have federal constitutional protection as a part of the free

9



exercise of religion”).
Thus, when disputes have arisen between church officials, this
Court has refused to wade into the conflict, and has rebuked the lower
courts for doing so. For example, when a Serbian Orthodox bishop
challenged his removal by his Yugoslavia-based Mother Church as arbitrary, this Court chided the lower court for “an impermissible rejection
of the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical tribunals . . . and impermissibly substituting its own inquiry into church polity.” Milivojevich,
426 U.S. at 708. To permit such civil courts to probe into church law
“would violate the First Amendment in much the same manner as civil
determination of religious doctrine.” Id. at 709.
In fact, it had long been established that “whenever the questions
of discipline . . . or law have been decided by the highest of these church
judicatories to which the matter has been carried, the legal tribunals
must accept such decisions as final.” Watson v. Jones, 80 U.S. 679, 727
(1872). The Milivojevich Court then explicitly went on to repudiate
any exception for “arbitrariness,” or upon a claim that the church had
failed to follow its own procedures. 713(“recognition of such an exception
10



would undermine the general rule that . . . a civil court must accept the
ecclesiastical decisions of church tribunals as it finds them”).
The ministerial exception, therefore, derives from this general deference to the internal workings of church procedures. Were the courts
to inquire into the reasons for why a minister was fired—whether for
doctrinal reasons or behavior prohibited under the ADA—they would
subvert a religion’s right to their own internal self-government. Cf.
id. at 724–25(“the First [ ] Amendment permit[s] hierarchical religious
organizations to establish their own rules and regulations for internal
discipline . . . and to create tribunals for adjudicating disputes over these
matters”).
2.

Courts violate the First Amendment when they attempt to determine
the proper activities or necessary qualifications of ministers

All parties here agree that Hosanna-Tabor Church and School is
a religious organization, as required by the ministerial exception. See
Hosanna-Tabor II, 597 F.3d at 778. Their dispute is strictly over whether
Ms. Perich was a “minister” for the purpose of the exception. See
id. However, any test that attempts to form classifications based on
11



their interpretation of religious doctrine will inevitably lead courts to
impermissibly entangle themselves in religion.
The Court of Appeals decided that Perich was not a minister using
their “primary duties test.” They relied on the finding of the district
court that Ms. Perich only spent roughly 45 minutes of a seven-hour
school day on strictly “religious” activities. Id. at 779. But this Court
has noted that “[t]he determination of what is a ‘religious’ [ ] practice
is more often than not a difficult and delicate task.” Thomas v. Review
Bd., 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981). In fact, the role of a teaching minister in
a Christian school is to imbue the Word of God into her entire educational mission. Thus the Court of Appeals erred in attempting to divide
Perich’s day into “religious” and “non-religious” activities. As Justice
Jackson noted, the parochial school experience as a whole—not merely
the “religious” parts—can be foundational for a child’s religious upbringing. See Everson, 330 U.S. at 24(Jackson, J., dissenting) (“I should be
surprised if any Catholic would deny that the parochial school is a vital, if not the most vital, part of the Roman Catholic Church. Catholic
education is the rock on which the whole structure rests.”).

12



When the Court of Appeals classified Ms. Perich’s service as nonreligious, and asserted that no meaningful distinction exists between
called and lay teachers, they issued their own judgment on a matter of
Lutheran doctrine. As the district court noted, the Church “does not give
the title to just any teacher.” Hosanna-Tabor I, 582 F. Supp. 2d at 891.
“That Hosanna-Tabor distinguishes between ‘lay’ and ‘called’ teachers
by awarding the commissioned minister title suggests that the school
values the latter employees as ministerial, even if some courts would
not.” Id. The Court of Appeals is not qualified to substitute its judgment
for that of Church authorities regarding the religious significance of Ms.
Perich’s call.
It would also be error, as Respondents have previously suggested,
to limit the exception to ordained ministers, as opposed to commissioned
ministers such as Ms. Perich. Such a rule would be tantamount to
a claim that “ordination,” as such, is a requirement for ministry. Not
only is such claim itself an encroachment on the freedom of the church
to define its own doctrine, but would require judicial examination of
the validity of the ordination of the individual member in question.

13



Such decisions are outside of the competence of the secular courts, and
therefore out of their jurisdiction.
Moreover, some religions ordain all members (such as Jehovah’s
Witnesses, who consider all members ordained by baptism) and some
religions do not formally ordain at all (such as the Quakers). See Note,
The Ministerial Exception To Title VII: The Case for a Deferential Primary Duties Test, 121 Harv. L. Rev. 1776, 1797 (2009). Accordingly,
an ordination test would impermissibly prefer certain denominations
based upon their creed. Cf. Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 246–47
(1982)(“when we are presented with a [ ] law granting a denominational
preference, our precedents demand that we treat the law as suspect and
that we apply strict scrutiny”).
3.

“Ministers” are those persons held out by churches as such

Courts should not attempt to assess the religious importance or
significance of a minister’s duties, in order to answer the question of
whether one is, or is not, a minister. They should instead limit their
inquiry to the reasonable, pre-dispute understandings of the parties as
to that question. For the purpose of the exception, it should be sufficient
14



to make a finding that a person is a minister if: (1) the church reasonably
holds her out to the public as a minister and (2) she accepts the church’s
designation. Such a test is manageable, and consistent with precedent.
By refusing to question the correctness of the decisions of church tribunals in church governance, this Court has recognized that individuals
may voluntarily bind themselves to the authority of these tribunals. See
Milivojevich, 426 U.S. at 711(“all who unite themselves to a [religious]
body do so with an implied consent to [its] government, and are bound
to submit to it”). So long as the church clearly and publicly designates
someone as a minister, the acceptance of that title—either formally, or
by taking advantage of the benefits that the title offers—implies consent
to be bound by its government. So long as they have made a choice to
accept the offer, they must take the bad with the good.
This test offers the advantage of a bright-line rule. As the Circuit
Courts have noted, whatever her religious duties, a minister is a voice of
her church—that is, hers is a public position. The Courts may consider,
then, whether an outsider—such as the court itself—would have reasonably perceived that person to have been held out by the church as acting
15



and speaking on its behalf. See, e.g., Petruska, 462 F.3d at 306. Such
consideration is well within the competence of civil courts, and courts
would be capable of recognizing the circumstance where a sham claim of
“ministry” is assigned after-the-fact to avoid liability.
But we stress that it is not necessary, in order for the Court to
resolve this case, to set out a test to deal with such deception. It is
unquestioned, as the district court noted, that both parties used the title
of “minister” long before the commencement of litigation. See HosannaTabor I, 582 F. Supp. 2d at 891. It is further unquestioned that Perich
accepted that title, and enjoyed its benefits—not least of which was the
tenure right that she now claims was violated.
C. Ms. Perich was titled a minister of the Hosanna-Tabor
Church, accepted her ministry, and thus was a minister
for the purpose of the exception
The district court was correct to find that Ms. Perich was a minister,
and subject to the ministerial exception. This Court thus should reverse
the erroneous ruling of the Court of Appeals. Before this lawsuit, Ms.
Perich embraced her role as a minister, rather than disclaiming it. She
16



attended the series of colloquy classes as training for the ministry. She
applied for, and received, a call to ministry from the Hosanna-Tabor
congregation. She took advantage of the housing allowance offered only
to those in the practice of ministry.
Moreover, neither she, nor a reasonable member of the public, could
have perceived the Church’s manifestations regarding Ms. Perich as
anything other than bestowing the title of minister. The entire Congregation voted to commission her as minister. Her name was placed in
the district-wide publication of commissioned teaching ministers. She
received an “official certificate of admission into the teaching ministry.”
And she did not reject these titles.
Moreover, the certification of admission was clear on the responsibilities Perich was being bound to. She was to commit herself to spreading
the Gospel, live as a Christian role model, provide her students with
a Christian education, and to live in Christian unity with co-workers.
The certificate made clear to Perich that she was being called to occupation in which Christianity would play a major role. By accepting,

17



she reasonably submitted herself to the church’s own (and well-known)
adjudicative procedures.
Yet when she was insubordinate and aggressive with her co-workers,
she violated her responsibilities as a Christian minister. And when she
threatened to sue without first proceeding through the dispute resolution
system, she was attempting to avoid her submission to the judgment
of the ecclesiastical tribunals to which she was bound. Given that this
Court has taken such a firm stance on the deference civil courts must
rant to ecclesiastical courts, this end-run around ecclesiastical courts
should not be allowed.
Finally, as the district court found, there was no subterfuge in this
case on the part of the Church. Any reasonable observer would have
seen Ms. Perich as a minister, and would have expected that she would
have been bound to rules and regulations of that particular religion. See
Hosanna-Tabor I, 582 F. Supp. 2d at 891(“This is not a case where the
defendant seeks to prove ministerial status after the fact merely to avoid
liability. Hosanna-Tabor treated Perich like a minister and held her
out to the world as such long before this litigation began.”). Therefore,
18



the Church prays this Court to confirm that Ms. Perich was a minister.
