\questionpresented{{Whether a Missouri Law that prohibits medical providers from performing abortions when the provider knows that the sole reason for the abortion is a screening or test that indicates the unborn child has Down's Syndrome (the Down's Syndrome provision) is facially invalid under \textit{Roe v.
