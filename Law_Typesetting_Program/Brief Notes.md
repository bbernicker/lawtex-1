Both *Roe* \cite[!]{Roe} and *Casey* \cite[!]{Casey} repeated this principle several different ways. According to *Casey*, "*Roe*'s central holding [was] that viability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions." \pincite{Casey}{860}. *Casey* also discussed "*Roe*'s view that a State's interest in the protection of life falls short of justifying any *plenary* override of individual liberty claims." \pincite{Casey}{857}~(emphasis added). It also reiterated that 

Similarly, *Roe* stated that "[w]here certain 'fundamental rights' are involved, the Court has held that regulation limiting these rights may be justified only by a 'compelling state interest,' and that legislative enactments must be narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interests at stake." \pincite{Roe}{155}~(internal citations omitted). The *Roe* court understood itself to be "vindicat[ing] the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment up to the points where important state interests provide compelling justifications for intervention." \pincite{Roe}{165-6}. 

All of these statements from *Roe* \cite[!]{Roe} and *Casey* \cite[!]{Casey} focus on the state's interests, rather than on the pregnant woman's right to choose an abortion. *Roe* and *Casey* did not hold, as the Eight Circuit held, that bans on categories of abortion are invalid even if they meet strict scrutiny. 

### Missouri has a compelling interest in eradicating invidious discrimination against people living with Down's Syndrome.

In other contexts, this Court has recognized that states have a compelling interest in eradicating invidious discrimination and remedying the effects of past discrimination. \Seeeg \pincite{Roberts}{610}~(eradicating gender discrimination); \cite{Shaw}~(remedying the effects of past race discrimination).

Missouri has a compelling interest in eradicating invidious discrimination against people living with Down's Syndrome. People living with Down's Syndrome have long faced significant invidious discrimination. They have been stigmatized, institutionalized, and even sterilized, and actors at all levels of government have been directly involved in their oppression.

That oppression persists. For example, in 2016, Carl DeBrodie, a Missourian with Down's Syndrome, was found dead in the home of two state contractors who worked at a residential facility for the disabled. One of the contractors, Sherry Paulo, admitted to bringing Carl to her home, confining him in a makeshift "jail cell" in her unfinished basement, depriving him of medicine he had been prescribed, and failing to intervene as he died. \pincite{Paulo Plea}{2-4}. She and her family then concealed Carl's death for months by encasing his corpse in cement and hiding it in a storage locker. \pincite{Paulo Plea}{2-4}. The county later settled a wrongful death lawsuit which alleged that Ms. Paulo forced Carl and another intellectually disabled resident to "physically fight each other for the benefit and amusement of Defendant Paulo and her family." \pincite{DeBrodie Lawsuit}{First Amended Complaint, ECF 53, pg. 24}; \pincite{DeBrodie Lawsuit}{Judgment Approving Wrongful Death Settlement, ECF 177}. Carl allegedly broke six ribs in these fights.  \pincite{DeBrodie Lawsuit}{First Amended Complaint, ECF 53, pg. 24}.

This is an extreme example, but it represents a broader issue. Since 1998, the U.S. Department of Justice has been required to track and report statistics about crimes against people with disabilities. \pincite{112 Stat}{ 2838}. According to the most recent data, people living with cognitive disabilities are more than 350\% more likely to be victims of violent crime than people who are not disabled. \cite{NCVS}. The FBI's most recent Uniform Crime Reports also show that the agency received more than 100 reports of hate crimes motivated by mental disability in 2019. \cite{UCR}. 

And of course, invidious discrimination does not always take the form of a hate crime or act of physical violence. People living with Down's Syndrome also experience social prejudice and discrimination. While these “[p]rivate biases may be outside the reach of the law, ... the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.” \pincite{Palmore}{433}.





In the decades immediately following *Roe*, even abortion advocates generally accepted that states could prevent discriminatory abortions. For example, and as explained above, the Pennsylvania statute at issue in *Casey* prohibited sex-selective abortions, but Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania opted not to challenge that provision. Including Missouri and Pennsylvania, ten states ban some or all sex-discriminatory pre-viability abortions.[^list of bans on sex-based abortions] Most of these sex-discrimination bans have never been challenged.[^list of challenges to sex discrimination bans]

These sex-discrimination statutes do not serve either of the state interests addressed in *Roe* or *Casey*, and nobody disputes that they substantially burden abortions based on discriminatory factors. But their often-unchallenged persistence and adoption demonstrate that states have compelling interests in rooting out discrimination, and that outright bans on certain discriminatory abortions can survive strict scrutiny even when they pose a substantial burden.



North Dakota has prohibited abortions based solely on a Down Syndrome diagnosis since 2013. \pincite{N.D. Cent. Code Ann.}{ \S 14-02.1-04.1} ~(West)~(also prohibiting sex-selective abortions). Louisiana has a similar law that prohibits pre-viability abortions after 20 weeks if those abortions are solely motivated by a diagnosis of a genetic abnormality. \pincite{La. Stat. Ann.}{\S 40:1061.1.2}. Neither law has been challenged.



Statement that Missouri values people with down syndrome would be empty if Missouri allowed women to decide that it would be per se better that people with Down Syndrome never be born.

Aborting an unborn child solely because they have down syndrome is akin to expressive hate speech.



[^list of bans on sex-based abortions]: \See \pincite{Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.}{ \S 13–3603.02}~(the portions of this statute pertaining to discrimination based on Down syndrome diagnoses have been enjoined in \cite{Isaacson}, but the sex-discrimination provision was not challenged and remains in effect); \pincite{Ark. Code}{ \S 20–16–1904}~(other portions of this statute have been enjoined in \cite{Hopkins}, but the sex-discrimination provision was not challenged and remains in effect); \pincite{Kan. Stat. Ann.}{ \S 65–6726}; \pincite{N.C. Gen. Stat.}{ \S 90–21.121}; \pincite{N.D. Cent. Code Ann.}{ \S 14–02.1–04.1}; \pincite{63 Okla. Stat.}{ \S 1–731.2(B)}; \pincite{S.D. Codified Laws}{ \S 34–23A–64}; \pincite{Miss. Code. Ann.}{ \S 41-41-407}.
[^list of challenges to sex discrimination bans]: Federal courts have enjoined the enforcement of statutes banning sex-discriminatory pre-viability abortions in four additional states for reasons that are inapplicable to the Missouri statutes at issue in this case. The Sixth Circuit held that a Tennessee statute prohibiting abortions based on sex, race, or a Down Syndrome diagnosis was unconstitutionally vague because, unlike the Missouri statute, it did not limit liability to situations where the discriminatory basis was the *sole* reason for the abortion. \Seegenerally \cite{Memphis}. Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky are the others.







*Roe* \cite[!]{Roe} and *Casey* \cite[!]{Casey} weighed a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy against two state interests: (1) protecting the health of pregnant mothers and (2) protecting the 'potential life' of unborn children. The Court held in *Roe*, and reaffirmed in *Casey*, that neither interest was compelling enough for abortion bans to satisfy strict scrutiny in the early stages of pregnancy. *Roe* \cite[!]{Roe} and *Casey* \cite[!]{Casey} left open the possibility, however, that other state interests might provide a compelling basis for regulating pre-viability abortion in certain circumstances.



These prohibitions are narrowly tailored to advance the state's interest.[^but see vaguer] They do not reach all abortions, or even all abortions of female fetuses. They instead focus on discriminatory intent and only prohibit abortions that are motivated solely by the sex of the unborn child. These prohibitions therefore withstand strict scrutiny. Indeed, the respondents in this case do not challenge Missouri's prohibition on sex discrimination in abortion decisions, just as the plaintiff's in *Casey* \cite[!]{Casey} did not challenge Pennsylvania's prohibition on sex-selective abortion when they challenged other provisions of the same statute. \See \pincite{18 Pa.C.S.A.}{\S 3204(c)}; \seealso \pincite{Respondents' Brief in Casey}{4}~(noting that there was no challenge to the sex-selective abortion bar).



The Missouri law at issue in this case is narrowly tailored because it only burdens women who seek an abortion *solely* because their unborn child has Down Syndrome.



[^but see vaguer]: Some of the state statutes are not limited only to abortions motivated "solely" by the sex of the fetus. \Seeeg North Carolina (Get the parenthetical), Tennessee.

 *Roe* \cite[!]{Roe} and *Casey* \cite[!]{Casey} weighed a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy against two state interests: (1) protecting the health of pregnant women and (2) protecting the `potential life' of unborn children. *Roe's* "essential holding," which *Casey* clarified, was that neither interest is compelling enough to support categorical bans on pre-viability abortions. \pincite{Casey}{846}. But *Casey* left open the possibility that other state interests would be compelling enough to justify bans on particular categories of pre-viability abortions.
